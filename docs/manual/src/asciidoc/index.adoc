= Spring Social LinkedIn Reference
Craig Walls; Keith Donald; Roy Clarkson

The Spring Social LinkedIn project is an extension to
http://www.springframework.org/spring-social[Spring Social] that enables
integration with LinkedIn.

== Introduction
http://www.linkedin.com[LinkedIn] is a social networking site geared toward professionals. 
It enables its users to maintain and correspond with a network of contacts they have are professionally linked to.

Spring Social LinkedIn enables integration with LinkedIn with
`LinkedInConnectionFactory`, a connection factory that can be plugged into
Spring Social's service provider connection framework, and with an API
binding to LinkedIn's REST API.

=== How to get

The following Gradle dependency will add Spring Social LinkedIn to your
project:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
compile "org.springframework.social:spring-social-linkedin:{spring-social-linkedin-version}"
----

Or in Maven:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.social</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-social-linkedin</artifactId>
  <version>{spring-social-linkedin-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

As an extension to Spring Social, Spring Social LinkedIn depends on
Spring Social. Spring Social's core module will be transitively resolved
from the Spring Social LinkedIn dependency. If you'll be using Spring
Social's web module, you'll need to add that dependency yourself.
In Gradle:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
compile "org.springframework.social:spring-social-web:{spring-social-version}"
----

Or in Maven:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.social</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-social-web</artifactId>
  <version>{spring-social-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Note that Spring Social LinkedIn may release on a different schedule
than Spring Social. Consequently, Spring Social's version may differ
from that of Spring Social LinkedIn.

Social's reference documentation] for more information on Spring Social
dependencies.

== Configuring LinkedIn Connectivity
Spring Social's `ConnectController` works with one or more provider-specific `ConnectionFactory` instances to exchange authorization details with the provider and to create connections. 
Spring Social LinkedIn provides `LinkedInConnectionFactory`, a `ConnectionFactory` for creating connections with LinkedIn.

So that `ConnectController` can find `LinkedInConnectionFactory`, it must be registered with a `ConnectionFactoryRegistry`. 
The following configuration class uses Spring Social's Java configuration support to register a `ConnectionFactory` for LinkedIn:

```java
@Configuration
public class SocialConfig implements SocialConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addConnectionFactories(ConnectionFactoryConfigurer cfConfig, Environment env) {
        cfConfig.addConnectionFactory(new LinkedInConnectionFactory(
            env.getProperty("linkedin.clientId"), 
            env.getProperty("linkedin.clientSecret")));
    }

    ...
}
```

If we wanted to add support for connecting to other providers, we would simply register their connection factories here in the same way as `LinkedInConnectionFactory`.

Because client IDs and secrets may be different across environments (e.g., test, production, etc) it is recommended that these values be externalized. As shown here, Spring's `Environment` abstraction is provided as a parameter to `addConnectionFactories()` so that it can look up the application's client ID and secret.

Optionally, you may also configure `LinkedInConnectionFactory` in XML.
Using Spring Social LinkedIn's XML configuration namespace:

```xml
<linkedin:config app-id="${linkedin.clientId}" 
                 app-secret="${linkedin.clientSecret}" 
                 app-namespace="socialshowcase" />
```

This is roughly equivalent to the Java-based configuration of `ConnectionFactoryRegistry` shown before. 
As in the Java-based configuration, the application's client ID and secret are externalized (shown here as property placeholders).

Refer to
http://docs.spring.io/spring-social/site/docs/1.1.0.RC1/reference/htmlsingle/index.html#connecting[Spring Social's reference documentation] for complete details on configuring `ConnectController` and its dependencies.

== LinkedIn API Binding
Spring Social LinkedIn offers integration with LinkedIn's REST API with the `LinkedIn` interface and its implementation, `LinkedInTemplate`.

To create an instance of `LinkedInTemplate`, you may pass in your application's OAuth 2 access token to the constructor:

```java
String accessToken = "..."; // The access token granted after OAuth authorization
LinkedIn linkedin = new LinkedInTemplate(accessToken);
```

If you are using Spring Social's
http://docs.spring.io/spring-social/site/docs/1.1.0.RC1/reference/htmlsingle/index.html#connectFramework[service provider framework], you can get an instance of `LinkedIn` from a `Connection`. For example, the following snippet calls `getApi()` on a connection to retrieve a `LinkedIn`:

```java
Connection<LinkedIn> connection = connectionRepository.findPrimaryConnection(LinkedIn.class);
if (connection != null) {
    LinkedIn linkedin = connection.getApi();

    // ... use LinkedIn API binding
}
```

Here, `ConnectionRepository` is being asked for the primary connection that the current user has with LinkedIn. 
If a connection to LinkedIn is found, it retrieves a `LinkedIn` instance that is configured with the connection details received when the connection was first established.

Once you have a `LinkedIn` you can use it to interact with LinkedIn's API on behalf of the user who the access token was granted for.

=== Retrieving a user's LinkedIn profile data
To retrieve the authenticated user's profile data, call the `getUserProfile()` method:

```java
LinkedInProfile profile = linkedin.getUserProfile();
```

The data returned in the `LinkedInProfile` includes the user's LinkedIn ID, first and last names, their "headline", the industry they're in, and URLs for the public and standard profile pages.

If it's only the user's LinkedIn ID you need, then you can get that by calling the `getProfileId()` method:

```java
String profileId = linkedin.getProfileId();
```

Or if you only need a URL for the user's public profile page, call `getProfileUrl()`:

```java
String profileUrl = linkedin.getProfileUrl();
```

=== Getting a user's LinkedIn connections
To retrieve a list of LinkedIn users to whom the user is connected, call the `getConnections()` method:

```java
List<LinkedInProfile> connections = linkedin.getConnections();
```

This will return a list of `LinkedInProfile` objects for the user's 1st-degree network (those LinkedIn users to whom the user is directly linked--not their extended network).
